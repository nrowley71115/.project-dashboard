I have an idea for a engineering landing page (i.e. second brain). It could be linked to and from my project dashboard, but would be it's own landing page.



It would consist of all types of information for work and E\&I engineering. It would contains helpful links to site and industry standards. It could also break down helpful notes or engineering guides on different types of work that I do like different types instrumentation or power projects (transformers, ATS, UPS).



This would have to be easily editable as I would actively add links to resources or edit my engineering notes as needed.
